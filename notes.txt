  equilibria
  limit matching on masses (at hamiltonian level)

9/14 meeting
  write up stuff
  write down
since double system has 6 degrees in phase space, the hamiltonian approach will be a 6th order equation to find the normal modes, might explore the lagrangian approach described in taylors chp 11 pg 417 (pdf 432)

9/18 meeting
  write up finite mode analysis
  write up isomorphism analysis
  run simulations to larger time scales to check for periodicity
    write function for determining if returned to point
  explore 0-angular momentum at different initial orientations
  explore 0-angular momentum with 0 for one of the phis
